# Route Planning Using OpenStreetMap Data

C++ application to find & map a shortest path between two points using "A*" (A-star) search algorithm and OpenStreetMap data.

OpenStreetMap is an open source project to create free, user generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in the Google Maps or Apple Maps app on your phone.

## Compiling and Running

### Environment
This project should be built and run on Linux environment, particularly on Ubuntun 18;

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executables will be placed in the `bin` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
../bin/<name-of-parent-directory> -f ../map.osm
```

## Testing

For exercises that have unit tests, the project must be built with the approprate test cpp file. This can be done by passing a string with the `-DTESTING` flag in `cmake`. For example, from the build directory:
```
cmake -DTESTING="RouteModel" ..
make
```
Those commands will build the code with the tests for the "Fill Out Route Model" exercise. The tests can then be run from the `build` directory as follows:
```
../bin/test
```
Exercises with tests will specify which string to pass with `-DTESTING`, but a table is given below with the complete list for reference:

| Exercise Name               | `-DTESTING` String Value |
|-----------------------------|:------------------------:|
| Fill Out Route Model        |       "RouteModel"       |
| Fill Out Node Class         |       "RMNodeClass"      |
| Create RouteModel Nodes     |        "RMSNodes"        |
| Write the Distance Function |        "NodeDist"        |
| Create Road to Node Hashmap |       "NodeToRoad"       |
| Write FindNeighbors         |      "FindNeighbors"     |
| Find the Closest Node       |       "FindClosest"      |
| Write the A\* Search Stub   |        "AStarStub"       |
| Finish A\* Search           |       "AStarSearch"      |
